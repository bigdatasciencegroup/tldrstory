    *Disclaimer: All titles and links are displayed as is from Reddit. Users agree to use their own discretion and accept
    responsibility for the links they click.*
      
    This application categorizes mobile device Reddit post titles by topic, score and sentiment. Data is pulled
    via the Reddit API using a series of queries for popular link posts. In many but not all cases, the titles of these posts are
    headlines for news articles.
      
    Reddit post titles are labeled using two categories:
      
      - Score - hard data vs rumors
      - Sentiment - happy vs unhappy
       
    ### Tech stack
      
    A zero-shot classifier, backed by a large general language model with no labeled data, is used to categorize topics,
    score and sentiment. Additionally, a txtai index enables ad hoc similarity searches against the data.
      
    The following libraries are used:

      - txtai
      - Transformers
      - Sentence Transformers
      - Streamlit
      - FastAPI
